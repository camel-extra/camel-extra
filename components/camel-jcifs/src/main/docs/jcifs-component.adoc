JCIFS Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.11.0*

This component provides access to remote file systems over the CIFS/SMB
networking protocol. The *camel-jcifs* library is provided by the
http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/[Camel Extra] project which hosts
all *GPL related components for Camel.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

xml <dependency> <groupId>org.apache-extras.camel-extra</groupId>
<artifactId>camel-jcifs</artifactId> <version>x.x.x</version> <!-- use
the same version as your Camel core version --> </dependency> Consuming
from remote server

Make sure you read the section titled _Default when consuming files_
further below for details related to consuming files.

URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

smb://[[[domain;]username[:password]@]server[:port]/[[share/[dir/]]]][?options]

Where *share* represents the share to connect to and *dir* is optionaly
any underlying directory. Can contain nested folders.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

This component uses the http://jcifs.samba.org/[JCIFS] library for the
actual CIFS/SMB work.

URI Options
^^^^^^^^^^^

The options below are exclusive for the JCIFS component.

confluenceTableSmall

Name

Default Value

Description

`password`

`null`

*Mandatory* Specifies the password to use to log in to the remote file
system.

`localWorkDirectory`

`null`

When consuming, a local work directory can be used to store the remote
file content directly in local files, to avoid loading the content into
memory. This is beneficial, if you consume a very big remote file and
thus can conserve memory. See below for more details.

More options

See link:file2.html[File] for more options as all the options from
link:file2.html[File] is inherited.

For example to set the `localWorkDirectory` to ''/tmp'' you can do:

java
from("smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret&localWorkDirectory=/tmp")
.to("bean:foo");

You can have as many of these options as you like.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

`smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret`  +

`smb://companydomain;foo@myserver.company.com/sharename?password=secret`

More information

This component is an extension of the link:file2.html[File] component.
So there are more samples and details on the link:file2.html[File]
component page.

Message Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following message headers can be used to affect the behavior of the
component

confluenceTableSmall

Header

Description

`CamelFileName`

Specifies the output file name (relative to the endpoint directory) to
be used for the output message when sending to the endpoint. If this is
not present and no expression either, then a generated message ID is
used as the filename instead.

`CamelFileNameProduced`

The actual absolute filepath (path + name) for the output file that was
written. This header is set by Camel and its purpose is providing
end-users the name of the file that was written.

`CamelFileBatchIndex`

Current index out of total number of files being consumed in this batch.

`CamelFileBatchSize`

Total number of files being consumed in this batch.

`CamelFileHost`

The remote hostname.

`CamelFileLocalWorkPath`

Path to the local work file, if local work directory is used.

Using Local Work Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel JCIFS supports consuming from remote servers and downloading the
files directly into a local work directory. This avoids reading the
entire remote file content into memory as it is streamed directly into
the local file using `FileOutputStream`.

Camel JCIFS will store to a local file with the same name as the remote
file. And finally, when the link:exchange.html[Exchange] is complete the
local file is deleted.

So if you want to download files from a remote server and store it as
files then you need to route to a file endpoint such as:

java
from("smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret&localWorkDirectory=/tmp")
.to("file://inbox"); Optimization by renaming work file

The route above is ultra efficient as it avoids reading the entire file
content into memory. It will download the remote file directly to a
local file stream. The `java.io.File` handle is then used as the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] body. The file producer leverages this fact
and can work directly on the work file `java.io.File` handle and perform
a `java.io.File.rename` to the target filename. As Camel knows it's a
local work file, it can optimize and use a rename instead of a file
copy, as the work file is meant to be deleted anyway.

Samples
^^^^^^^

In the sample below we set up Camel to download all the reports from the
SMB/CIFS server once every hour (60 min) and store it as files on the
local file system.

java protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception \{
return new RouteBuilder() \{ public void configure() throws Exception \{
// we use a delay of 60 minutes (eg. once pr. hour) we poll the server
long delay = 60 * 60 * 1000L; // from the given server we poll (=
download) all the files // from the public/reports folder and store this
as files // in a local directory. Camel will use the filenames from the
server
from("smb://foo@myserver.example.com/public/reports?password=secret&delay="
+ delay) .to("file://target/test-reports"); } }; }
from("smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret&amp;delay=60000")
.to("file://target/test-reports")

And the route using Spring DSL:

xml <route> <from
uri="smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret&amp;delay=60000"/>
<to uri="file://target/test-reports"/> </route>

Filter using `org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileFilter`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports pluggable filtering strategies. This strategy it to use
the build in `org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileFilter` in
Java. You can then configure the endpoint with such a filter to skip
certain filters before being processed.

In the sample we have built our own filter that only accepts files
starting with report in the filename.

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-ftp/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/remote/FromFtpRemoteFileFilterTest.java}

And then we can configure our route using the *filter* attribute to
reference our filter (using `#` notation) that we have defined in the
spring XML file:

xml <!-- define our sorter as a plain spring bean --> <bean
id="myFilter" class="com.mycompany.MyFileFilter"/> <route> <from
uri="smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret&amp;filter=#myFilter"/>
<to uri="bean:processInbox"/> </route>

Filtering using ANT path matcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ANT path matcher is a filter that is shipped out-of-the-box in the
*camel-spring* jar. So you need to depend on *camel-spring* if you are
using Maven.  +
 The reason is that we leverage Spring's
http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.html[AntPathMatcher]
to do the actual matching.

The file paths are matched with the following rules:

* `?` matches one character
* `*` matches zero or more characters
* `**` matches zero or more directories in a path

The sample below demonstrates how to use it:

xml <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
<template id="camelTemplate"/> <!-- use myFilter as filter to allow
setting ANT paths for which files to scan for --> <endpoint
id="mySMBEndpoint"
uri="smb://foo@myserver.example.com/sharename?password=secret&amp;recursive=true&amp;filter=#myAntFilter"/>
<route> <from ref="mySMBEndpoint"/> <to uri="mock:result"/> </route>
</camelContext> <!-- we use the AntPathMatcherRemoteFileFilter to use
ant paths for includes and exclude --> <bean id="myAntFilter"
class="org.apache.camel.component.file.AntPathMatcherGenericFileFilter">
<!-- include any files in the sub folder that has day in the name -->
<property name="includes" value="**/subfolder/**/*day*"/> <!-- exclude
all files with bad in name or .xml files. Use comma to separate multiple
excludes --> <property name="excludes" value="**/*bad*,**/*.xml"/>
</bean> link:endpoint-see-also.html[Endpoint See Also]
